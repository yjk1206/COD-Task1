NAME : YALLA NARAYANARAO ID : CT08WX63 DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE DURATION : "5th MARCH 2025 to 5th MAY 2025‚Äù (8 WEEKS) MENTOR NAME : SRAVANI GOUNI DESCRIPTION : For this exploratory data analysis (EDA) task, I've chosen a dataset on housing prices in a suburban area. The dataset contains various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and sale price. I used Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to explore and visualize the data.

After loading the dataset, I started by examining its structure using methods like .info() and .describe() to get an overview of the variables and their data types. I checked for missing values and handled them appropriately, either by imputing missing values or dropping rows/columns if necessary.

Next, I created histograms to visualize the distributions of numerical variables like square footage and sale price. This helped me understand the central tendency and spread of these features. I also used scatter plots to explore relationships between variables, such as the correlation between square footage and sale price.

To further investigate correlations, I generated a heatmap using seaborn to visualize the correlation matrix of numerical variables. This provided insights into which features are strongly correlated with each other and with the target variable, sale price.

During the analysis, I identified outliers using box plots and scatter plots, considering their potential impact on the analysis and whether they should be treated or kept for further investigation. CONCLUSION : In conclusion, the EDA revealed valuable insights into the housing dataset. It provided a clear understanding of the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers. This information can be utilized for further analysis, such as building predictive models or identifying factors that influence housing prices in the suburban area.
